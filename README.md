# Welcome to Web3-MCT! 

A blockchain club inclusive to all, focused on providing value to as many community as possible. Our goal is to unite the ecosystem and create a safe place for our peers to come collaborate, share ideas, vent their problems, and talk about solutions. We are a community first club, and we take pride in our ability to work together on the global stage, the blockchain.

This document is the first draft of our project Unilite Wallet. Together we will transition the Decentralized applications, browser based wallets, and ordinal marketplaces onto the Litecoin blockchain.
